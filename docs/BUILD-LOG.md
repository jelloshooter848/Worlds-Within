# Build log

What each engine release built and the choices made along the way, newest first. The plan for each
release is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); this file records what actually happened, so the owner can
review the choices.

## Engine 0.2

Restructure and the dependency rule. Built on branch `engine/build-0.15`; not tagged (tagging is the
owner's call).

### What was built

- **Target layout.** `src/` is gone. The engine is in `engine/core`; the renderer split into the
  contract in `engine/core/gfx` and two backends, `engine/backends/canvas2d` (canvas renderer and
  viewport) and `engine/backends/null` (headless renderer). `engine/sim` and `engine/tools` hold only
  their `CLAUDE.md` for now. The kit is in `kits/topdown`, the demo in `games/demo` with its own
  `index.html` and `main.ts`.
- **Multi-page build.** `build/pages.ts` finds every `games/*/index.html` and
  `games/samples/*/index.html`; Vite builds each as its own page plus a root launcher that links to
  every game. `pnpm dev` opens the launcher. Links are relative, so the pages work under `VITE_BASE`.
- **The dependency rule, enforced twice.** `config/layers.js` is the one table of allowed arrows.
  `config/deps.js` checks one arrow; `tests/architecture/dependency-rule.test.ts` scans every import
  in the repo with it, and a local ESLint plugin (`config/eslint-plugin-layers.js`) runs the same
  checker per folder. `tests/architecture/eslint-deps.test.ts` feeds deliberate bad imports
  (`kits/topdown` importing `games/demo`, `engine/sim` importing a backend, and more) to both and
  checks both reject them.
- **The purity rule.** ESLint bans `Math.random`, `Date.now`, `performance.now` and DOM globals in
  `engine/sim`, `kits/` and the pure part of `engine/core`. `tests/architecture/purity.test.ts`
  checks that a `Math.random()` in `kits/` fails lint, and that every core file kits or the sim reach
  at run time is on the pure list.
- **Content audit.** No game content was found in `engine/` or `kits/`.
  `tests/architecture/no-content.test.ts` scans non-test, non-fixture files for songs, MML strings,
  room literals, sprite definitions and text grids, so the rule cannot drift.
- **Pages workflow.** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs CI's checks and publishes `dist/` to GitHub
  Pages on a three-part `engine-v*` or `ww-v*` tag (or by hand). Nothing was published during this
  build.
- **Agent docs.** Every new module folder has a `CLAUDE.md`: `engine/core`,
  `engine/backends/canvas2d`, `engine/backends/null`, `engine/sim`, `engine/tools`, `kits/topdown`,
  `games/demo`, plus `build/`.

### Choices made

- **Test files may import `engine/backends/null`.** The one exception to the layer table
  (`EXCEPTIONS` in `config/layers.js`): any `*.test.ts` may run headless through the null backend,
  even in a layer (such as `kits/`) that may not import backends in its own code.
- **The pure-core list.** Rather than make all of `engine/core` pure (it holds the audio output,
  saving and browser input, which need the DOM), `PURE_CORE` in `config/layers.js` lists the core
  files that must stay pure: `rng.ts`, `math/**`, `scene.ts`, the input actions, bindings, manager
  and scripted input, the renderer contract, palette, animation, screen and spritesheet maths, and the
  MML parser. The purity test fails if kits or the sim start reaching a core file not on the list.
- **Aliases.** `@engine/*` points at `engine/*` and `@kits/*` at `kits/*`. The old `@sim` and `@game`
  aliases were dropped, and no alias points into `games/`.
- **Fit maths moved into core.** The pure viewport fit maths moved to `engine/core/gfx/screen.ts`, so
  the touch layout in core does not reach into a backend.
- **Fixtures.** Engine and kit test content lives in `*.test.ts` files or `__fixtures__/` folders;
  anything else under `engine/` or `kits/` that looks like content fails the no-content test.

### Verified (Done when)

- `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` pass (31 test files, 347 tests).
- `games/demo` plays as before: the headless demo test passes, and in a browser (`vite preview` with
  Playwright) the launcher lists `games/demo/`, the demo draws the courtyard room with no console
  errors, and the hero moves with the arrow keys.
- Deliberate bad imports fail both ESLint and the dependency test; `Math.random()` in `kits/` fails
  lint.
- A `git grep` for content (MML strings, song channels, room or sprite grids) under `engine/` and
  `kits/` finds only the audio engine's own type and channel names, no content.
